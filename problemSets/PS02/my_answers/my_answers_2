	\begin{itemize}
		\item Please show your work! You may lose points by simply writing in the answer.

If you are not sure if work needs to be shown for a particular problem, please ask.
		\item Your homework should be submitted electronically on GitHub in \texttt{.pdf} form.
		\item This problem set is due before 23:59 on Sunday February 19, 2023. No late assignments will be accepted.
	%	\item Total available points for this homework is 80.
	\end{itemize}

	
	%	\vspace{.25cm}
	
%\noindent In this problem set, you will run several regressions and create an add variable plot (see the lecture slides) in \texttt{R} using the \texttt{incumbents\_subset.csv} dataset. Include all of your code.

%\section*{Question 1} %(20 points)}
%\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We're interested in what types of international environmental agreements or policies people support (\href{https://www.pnas.org/content/110/34/13763}{Bechtel and Scheve 2013)}. So, we asked 8,500 individuals whether they support a given policy, and for each participant, we vary the (1) number of countries that participate in the international agreement and (2) sanctions for not following the agreement. \\

\noindent Load in the data labeled \texttt{climateSupport.csv} on GitHub, which contains an observational study of 8,500 observations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Response variable: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{choice}: 1 if the individual agreed with the policy; 0 if the individual did not support the policy
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	Explanatory variables: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		\texttt{countries}: Number of participating countries [20 of 192; 80 of 192; 160 of 192]
		\item
		\texttt{sanctions}: Sanctions for missing emission reduction targets [None, 5\%, 15\%, and 20\% of the monthly household costs given 2\% GDP growth]
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\noindent Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Remember, we are interested in predicting the likelihood of an individual supporting a policy based on the number of countries participating and the possible sanctions for non-compliance.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [] Fit an additive model. Provide the summary output, the global null hypothesis, and $p$-value. Please describe the results and provide a conclusion.
		%\item
		%How many iterations did it take to find the maximum likelihood estimates?
	\end{enumerate}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=38, lastline=70]{my_answers2.R}  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [Output 1] The coefficients of the model represent the change in the log odds of supporting the policy associated with a one-unit change in the independent variable. For example, a one-unit increase in "countries" is associated with a 0.458452 increase in the log odds of supporting the policy, holding all other variables constant.
		\item[Output 2] The output of the ANODEV test shows that the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, which indicates that the addition of the explanatory variables significantly improves the model fit. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that the intercept-only model is adequate, and we can conclude that the model including the number of participating countries and sanctions is a better fit for the data.

		Would the answers to 2a and 2b potentially change if we included the interaction term in this model? Why? 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Perform a test to see if including an interaction is appropriate.

			\end{lstlisting}
		\item The output of the ANODEV test shows that the p-value is 0.3912, which is greater than the usual significance level of 0.05. This suggests that including the interaction term does not significantly improve the model fit, and the additive model is adequate. Therefore, we can conclude that the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables is well-captured by the additive model that includes only the main effects.
